<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The software required to implement interactive techniques in data visualisation has become readily available to statisticians with the development of web-based graphics and several open-source R packages. This paper proposes using the R packages, <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>, to teach a set of powerful techniques for interactive data visualisation. The value of applying linked brushing, identification, scaling, subset selection and tours, to reveal further insight during exploratory data analysis will be demonstrated. Outliers are quickly examined using linked brushing and identification to better understand how they are unusual. Different structures in the data are explored with interactive scaling and subset selection. Dynamic tours provide views of complex multivariate structures and linked brushing enables multiple representations of the data to be explored simultaneously and related together. The additional insights gained from applying interactive data visualisation in comparison to analysis with static plots alone, show that the set of interactive techniques and software identified is a powerful toolbox for statisticians to have.</p>
<p>For direct access to all interactive plots this paper is recommended to be read online at <a href="https://shanl33.github.io/Honours_Report/" class="uri">https://shanl33.github.io/Honours_Report/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In discussing the technical tools available to statisticians, <span class="citation">Tukey (<a href="#ref-Tukey">1965</a>)</span> highlighted: “Today, software and hardware together provide far more powerful factories than most statisticians realize, factories that many of today’s most able young people find exciting and worth learning about” (p. 25).</p>
<p>Although Tukey’s comments in 1965 were in response to the impact of computers on statistical practices at the time, his words are still relevant in the 21st Century. The introduction of the internet and the development of web-based graphics, have provided easy access to “powerful factories” for creating interactive visualisations. Furthermore, the open-source R <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R">2013</a>)</span> software has made a wide range of statistical tools accessible and it continues to grow with the development of supporting R packages. This paper examines how interactive techniques have been applied in data analysis and demonstrates the practicalities and value of using current open-source, code-based software to implement interactive data visualisation.</p>
<div id="method" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Method</h2>
<p>The first stage of this research involved a survey of the techniques and open-source software currently available. A literature review helped to identify commonly used interactive techniques. The software tools were then evaluated against these techniques, in terms of coverage and ease of application. A focal set of software tools was then established and used to explore the role of interactive data visualisation in the data analysis cycle.</p>
<p>The second stage of research applied interactive techniques in exploratory data analysis of a dataset not previously examined in the literature. It highlights the difference in the value of the insights gained using interactive over static visualisation and examines whether this difference warrants interactive data visualisation being learnt by graduate statisticians.</p>
<p>Section <a href="#techniques">2</a> of this paper introduces a set of interactive techniques that are recommended in the literature. A range of software tools will then be compared in Section <a href="#software">3</a>, leading to a further examination of the R packages <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>. Finally, Section <a href="#application">4</a> demonstrates how interactive techniques can be applied to exploratory data analysis, using results from the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA).</p>
<p>All interactive visuals used in this paper can be accessed either via the links provided with their static screenshots, or are directly available from within the online version of this paper which can be viewed at <a href="https://shanl33.github.io/Honours_Report/" class="uri">https://shanl33.github.io/Honours_Report/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="findings" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Findings</h2>
<p>Different types of linked brushing, identification, scaling, subset selection and tours, were found to be commonly used techniques in interactive data visualisation. Using the R packages <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>crosstalk</strong> together, or in combination with <strong>shiny</strong> software, provided a code-based, open-source approach towards applying these interactive techniques. Awareness of the limitations and code efficiency of each software, enabled the efficient application of interactive techniques to exploratory data analysis of a ‘real’ dataset.</p>
<p>Applying interactive techniques in exploratory data analysis resulted in further insight into underlying multivariate structures. Outliers could be quickly examined using linked brushing and identification to better understand how they were unusual. Being able to interactively change the scaling on axes allowed the patterns revealed by different scales to be easily compared and consolidated. Interactive subset selection helped to reduce overplotting and allowed the effect of sample size on analysis to be explored. Tours enabled models to be examined in the multidimensional data space and linked brushing related projections together with other graphical respresentations of data and analysis.</p>
<p>The amount of effort and code required for implementing interactive techniques varied depending on the software used. Generally more than one open-source code-based software package was required when applying interactive data visualisation. The combination of <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> provided thorough coverage of the key interactive techniques and enabled interactive data visualisation for exploratory data analysis. The code for implementing interactive techniques for one analysis could be modified for further use, making the initial investment in time and effort worthwhile. Furthermore the interactivity allowed exploratory questions to be addressed quickly and encouraged more questions about the data to be explored. The relative ease of applying interactive techniques compared to the deeper insight gained in analysis justifies teaching interactive data visualisation to graduate students.</p>

<div id="techniques" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Literature review of interactive techniques</h1>
<p>Data visualisation is the use of graphics to gain further insight during exploratory and confirmatory statistical analysis <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. In addition, <em>interactive</em> data visualisation uses graphics that respond to user actions, generally via the mouse, to achieve fast and flexible analysis <span class="citation">(Unwin <a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>. The data analysis process described by <span class="citation">Cook and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span> provides a structure and context for meaningful interactive data visualisation. They emphasise the value of interactive techniques in identifying the problem statement, preparing the data, enriching the exploratory and quantitative analysis, and lastly in the presentation of findings. The interactive techniques introduced by <span class="citation">Cook and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span> will form the basis of discussion, intermixed with contributions from other literature.</p>
<p>In their worked examples, <span class="citation">Cook and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span> primarily used the interactive data visualisation software, <strong>GGobi</strong>. The open-source, code-based R packages <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> were used instead to create the examples in this section. References to the strengths and weaknesses of these software will be mentioned, but discussed in more detail in the Section <a href="#software">3</a>.</p>

<div id="linked-brushing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Linked brushing</h2>
<p>The interactive technique of linked brushing involves using the mouse (like a paintbrush) to select graphical features, which then prompts related features in the same plot and/or other plots to be highlighted <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. There are different types of linked brushing, depending on the linking rule used. The most basic form of linking is one-to-one. Figures <a href="#fig:one2one">2.1</a> and <a href="#fig:one2one2">2.2</a> demonstrate linked brushing between a plot representing the two categorical variables of the <strong>crabs</strong> dataset and a scatterplot of the carapace length and rear width. The linking can be initiated by brushing points in either plot. The brushed regions are marked by a dashed boundary. Figure <a href="#fig:one2one2">2.2</a> also demonstrates persistent brushing, where the results from previous selections are retained in subsequent brushing. Cases linked by different ‘brushes’ are also distinguished by colour in Figure <a href="#fig:one2one2">2.2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Instead of linking by case, a categorical variable can also be used to define the linking rule. This results in all members of the same level being highlighted, once one member is brushed <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. Gender is used as the linking rule in Figure <a href="#fig:catbrush">2.3</a> so that brushing one female crab links to highlighting points for all female crabs in the same plot.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The categorical brushing demonstrated in Figure <a href="#fig:catbrush">2.3</a> was implemented using <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> software. The text box below the plot shows the data output produced from the interactive brushing. How this output relates to the graphical features brushed depends on the type of plot involved. For a scatterplot the data output can be easily related back to the plot features, as well as the dataset. The code below shows the use of the <code>event_data</code> function in <strong>shiny</strong> to ‘capture’ the details from the interactive brushing. This information is then used to subset the <strong>crabs</strong> dataset for updating the plot. For a scatterplot, the <code>pointNumber</code> records the row numbers of the brushed points, offset by one, and hence it provides a direct way to relate the interactivity back to the dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Record data from brushing (&quot;sp1&quot; refers to the scatterplot)
s &lt;- event_data(&quot;plotly_selected&quot;, source=&quot;sp1&quot;)
# When brushing occurs subset the dataset by the selected sex
if (length(s)) {
  rowBrushed &lt;- s$pointNumber + 1
  subsetCrabs &lt;- crabs[which(crabs[rowBrushed, &quot;sex&quot;]==crabs$sex), ]
}</code></pre>
<p>It is more difficult to relate the data output from brushing aggregate plots, like histograms, back to the plot features and dataset. One of the limitations of the <strong>crosstalk</strong> package for linked brushing is its dependency on plots that individually identify cases. With web-based graphics, defining a linking rule from brushing on aggregated data is more challenging than linked brushing by case <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-crosstalk">2017</a><a href="#ref-crosstalk">a</a>)</span>. Although not impossible, the user needs to explicitly communicate details of the aggregation. This becomes more challenging when continuous variables are aggregated, or several categorical variables are involved. The web-based R package <strong>animint</strong> attempts to make the implementation of aggregate brushing easier, but it is currently limited to discrete values and does not retain the flexibility of brushing by case <span class="citation">(Hocking <a href="#ref-animint">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Linked brushing within a parallel coordinates plot (PCP) provides an example of <em>m</em>-to-<em>n</em> linking. A PCP displays multiple variables in a single plot by using parallel axes, rather than being restricted to two orthogonal axes, as in a scatterplot. Variable values on adjacent axes belonging to the same observation are joined by line segments. The parallel axes are typically scaled individually to maximise the use of space on the plot, but global values can be used to establish a common scale for all axes as well <span class="citation">(Unwin <a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>. Figure <a href="#fig:m2nuni">2.4</a> uses five vertical axes, scaled individually to the range of each physical measurement recorded in the <strong>crabs</strong> dataset. The edges joining the nodes are relatively horizontal, which suggests there is positive correlation between adjacent variables. Brushing the highest value on the <strong>RW</strong> axis links together the five physical measurements of the crab with the largest rear width. Hence linking together <em>m</em> nodes with <em>n</em> edges.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:m2nuni"></span>
<img src="files/m2n_uni.jpg" alt="An example of m-to-n linking and identification. The five physical measurements of the crab with the largest rear width are linked together by brushing. Tooltips identify the crab as a female Orange crab." width="500px" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Different types of linked brushing require varying amounts of effort to implement with the code-based software examined. One-to-one linked brushing is easily implemented with minimal code when using the <code>SharedData</code> function in the <strong>crosstalk</strong> package. In addition to the code for creating the two static plots in Figure <a href="#fig:one2one">2.1</a>, only one more command was required to establish the link between the points.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>crabsSD &lt;- SharedData$new(crabs, key=~rownames(crabs), group=&quot;one2one&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, general applications of <em>m</em>-to-<em>n</em> linking, such as complex categorical brushing and aggregate brushing, would require more effort and coding by the user. Furthermore the relative ease provided by each software for certain types of linked brushing also differs. Using <strong>shiny</strong> to implement one-to-one linked brushing would require ‘manually’ subsetting the data, similar to the process demonstrated for Figure <a href="#fig:catbrush">2.3</a>. Hence <strong>crosstalk</strong> is generally a more efficient software to use when one-to-one linked brushing is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="identification" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Identification</h2>
<p>Identification using tooltips is also demonstrated in Figure <a href="#fig:m2nuni">2.4</a>. Labels containing variable values appear as the mouse hovers over graphical features related to the values. <span class="citation">Theus (<a href="#ref-tourdefrance">2017</a><a href="#ref-tourdefrance">b</a>)</span> refers to this technique as “querying” the data and applies it to quickly answer basic questions during exploratory data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="scaling" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Scaling</h2>
<p>The use of different scales in visual displays can reveal different features of the data <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Theus (<a href="#ref-tourdefrance">2017</a><a href="#ref-tourdefrance">b</a>)</span> uses a PCP to analyse the time taken by cyclists to finish each stage of the 2013 Tour de France competition. Using the graphical user interface (GUI) in the <strong>Mondrian</strong> software, <span class="citation">Theus (<a href="#ref-tourdefrance">2017</a><a href="#ref-tourdefrance">b</a>)</span> interactively changes the scaling on the parallel axes to make a variety of comparisons between the difficult of different stages of the race and the progress of the riders.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:m2nglobal">2.5</a> displays the same data as in Figure <a href="#fig:m2nuni">2.4</a>, but uses the overall range of the five physical measurements to apply a common scale to the parallel axes. The crab with the largest rear width is again brushed and identified. The change in scaling makes the correlation between variables more difficult to confirm in Figure <a href="#fig:m2nglobal">2.5</a> and the nodes harder to brush individually, than in Figure <a href="#fig:m2nuni">2.4</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Being able to zoom in and out of a plot provides another mode of interactive scaling. This can be particularly useful for viewing busy regions of a plot <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. By default, all interactive plots created using the <strong>plotly</strong> package have zoom and pan controls that are accessible via its hovering menu of interactive techniques at the top of the plot <span class="citation">(Sievert <a href="#ref-plotlyBook">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="line-segments" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Line segments</h2>
<p>Line segments are essential to visualisations involving longitudinal data and are often used to represent models <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Wickham, Cook, and Hofmann (<a href="#ref-blindfold">2015</a>)</span> analysed a clustering algorithm by creating a dynamic visualisation using grid lines to represent models generated at each iteration. In network graphs, line segments define characteristics of connections between nodes. For example the weight of line segments between people (nodes) in a social network can reflect the frequency of exchanges between two people. Hence being able to brush and query line segments would be useful when applying interactive data visualisation to network analysis <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Unlike <strong>GGobi</strong>, the web-based software tools examined were unable to brush lines. The linked brushing previously demonstrated on the PCP was achieved by brushing a node on the <strong>RW</strong> variable’s axis. Similarly, the <strong>Mondrian</strong> software limits brushing on a PCP to the nodes <span class="citation">(Theus <a href="#ref-mondrian">2017</a><a href="#ref-mondrian">a</a>)</span>. When demonstrating brushing on dendrograms using <strong>plotly</strong> software, <span class="citation">Sievert (<a href="#ref-dendro">2016</a>)</span> was also restricted to brushing the nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="subset-selection" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Subset selection</h2>
<p>Subset selection involves using only a portion of the data for visualisation and/or analysis.

The <strong>shiny</strong> software provides different interactive input controls for subsetting data before mapping to graphical features or performing statistical analysis. Furthermore since interactive visuals created with <strong>shiny</strong> are connected to an active R session, it allows for analysis to be dynamically updated <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-shiny">2017</a><a href="#ref-shiny">c</a>)</span>.

<p><span class="citation">Wickham et al. (<a href="#ref-tourr">2011</a>)</span> highlight tours as essential for gaining insight into the structures underlying real-valued multivariate data. A tour is an animation consisting of static low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional data space. The projections are determined by linear combinations of real-valued variables. Figure <a href="#fig:crabstour">2.6</a> shows a 2D tour that consists of two-dimensional projections of the five-dimensional data space spanned by the real-valued variables of the <strong>crabs</strong> dataset. The projections to include in a tour can be manually determined, randomly chosen, or guided by algorithms measuring the ‘interestingness’ of views, such as projection pursuits <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. The latter two options are referred to as grand tours and guided tours, respectively. <span class="citation">Wickham et al. (<a href="#ref-tourr">2011</a>)</span> define guided tours as a “dynamic form of projection pursuit” and highlight the value of being able to examine views of local maxima, in addition to the final ‘solution’ (p. 4).</p>
<p>The <strong>crabs</strong> dataset was examined by <span class="citation">Venables and Ripley (<a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span> using principal component analysis (PCA) on the log values of the five physical measurements. PCA reveals interesting multivariate structures by finding projections of the data that show maximal variability <span class="citation">(Venables and Ripley <a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span>. Like tours, PCA uses linear combinations of real-valued variables to define projections. Hence it is possible to observe projections equivalent to plots of the principal components within a tour <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>A plot of the second and third principal components of the log values of the <strong>crabs</strong> dataset was identified by <span class="citation">Venables and Ripley (<a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span> as almost separating the four sex-species crab classes. This orthogonal projection is used as the starting basis for the tour in Figure <a href="#fig:crabstour">2.6</a>. On the right of the tour plot, line segments are used to represent the orientation of tour projections with respect to the original variables, in this case the principal components. This “axis tree” allows the structures identified in projections to be related back to the original variables <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>, 34)</span>. The R package <strong>tourr</strong>, enables projection pursuit indices and geodesic interpolation between projections to be applied. The interpolation between projections is a stochastic process, hence the views observed will vary between tours <span class="citation">(Wickham et al. <a href="#ref-tourr">2011</a>)</span>. The projection identified by <span class="citation">Venables and Ripley (<a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span> indicated a sparse distribution at the centre and so the ‘holes’ projection pursuit index was applied. By clicking on the ‘Play’ button or using the slider in Figure <a href="#fig:crabstour">2.6</a>, we can view the projections from the guided tour to further explore the ‘neighbourhood’ identified by <span class="citation">Venables and Ripley (<a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> A survey of software tools</h1>
<p>One of the challenges of interactive data visualisation is documenting the interactions applied during analysis <span class="citation">(Unwin <a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>. The development of code-based software, such as R packages, provide possible solutions to address this issue. However the demonstrations of interactive techniques in Section <a href="#techniques">2</a>, show that a code-based approach towards achieving the scope of techniques possible in <strong>GGobi</strong>, requires the use of more than one software. This section compares the ease of application, development progress and coverage of interactive techniques, for a range of open-source, code-based software tools. A set of key software tools will be identified and discussed in more detail.</p>
<div id="types" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Types of interactive software</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Lang and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Lang">2001</a>)</span> describe two types of interactive data visualisation software, those with a direct manipulation graphical environment and those driven by a command-line interface. <strong>GGobi</strong> and <strong>Mondrian</strong> are examples of software programs that have a GUI for direct manipulation. GUI environments provide immediate response to user actions, but without technical knowledge of the underlying low-level language, it is difficult to modify or extend these types of software <span class="citation">(Lang and Swayne <a href="#ref-Lang">2001</a>)</span>. On the other hand, command-line interfaces, such as R, not only allow modification of existing capabilities, but also the creation of new functions. In addition, the R software provides access to a vast range of techniques and tools for statistical analysis <span class="citation">(Unwin <a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>R packages for interactive data visualisation aim to reap the benefits of a graphical interface, the extensibility of a scripting language, as well as the statistical power of the R environment. The package <strong>rggobi</strong> connects the <strong>GGobi</strong> GUI with R, to enable complex interactive graphical analyses that would be difficult, if not impossible, to carry out without a command-line interface <span class="citation">(Lawrence et al. <a href="#ref-Lawrence">2009</a>)</span>. Meanwhile packages like <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>, use the interactive graphics provided by the web, alongside the statistical functions accessible in R. The use of web browsers minimises the software requirements for accessing these packages. <span class="citation">Unwin (<a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span> highlights that the shift towards web-based software helps to make sharing and presenting analyses from interactive data visualisations easier. In contrast <strong>rggobi</strong> is dependent on the installation of <strong>GGobi</strong> and the specific software required for building the <strong>GGobi</strong> GUI. Consequently the ease of access to <strong>rggobi</strong> is at a disadvantage to the other R packages.</p>
<p>Other R packages for interactive data visualisation include <strong>trelliscopejs</strong> and <strong>animint</strong>. Like <strong>plotly</strong> these software build on the comprehensive graphing system provided by the R package <strong>ggplot2</strong>. By adding interactive functions, <strong>trelliscopejs</strong>, <strong>animint</strong> and <strong>plotly</strong>, convert static <strong>ggplot2</strong> objects into web-based interactive plots. The <strong>trelliscopejs</strong> package focuses on adding interactive techniques to trellis plots. <span class="citation">Hafen (<a href="#ref-trelliscope">2017</a>)</span> describes <strong>trelliscopejs</strong> as enabling “interactivity for free” and emphasises that adding interactivity should require little time and effort beyond that needed to create the static plot (Why Trelliscope, para. 3). The design behind <strong>animint</strong> reflects a similar sentiment but enables interactivity for a wider range of plot types. It enables linked brushing by introducing additional arguments to the mapping system used in <strong>ggplot2</strong>. However currently this interactive technique can only be activated by conditioning on categorical or discrete variables <span class="citation">(Hocking <a href="#ref-animint">2017</a>)</span>. Furthermore all calculations are pre-computed before plot compilation and hence genuine ‘real-time’ analysis in response to interactivity is not possible. The <strong>plotly</strong> package shares this limitation, but it can be paired with other software to enables more flexible brushing and a wider variety of linking. Furthermore <strong>plotly</strong> appears to be further along in its development, unlike <strong>trelliscopejs</strong> and <strong>animint</strong>, as it is already available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). For the purposes of teaching, the availability of <strong>plotly</strong> on CRAN provides two important advantages, ease of installation and a level of reliability <span class="citation">(Wickham <a href="#ref-cran">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Instead of adding interactive components to <strong>ggplot2</strong> objects, the <strong>ggvis</strong> package shares a similar syntax, inspired by the grammar of graphics <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-ggvis">2017</a><a href="#ref-ggvis">b</a>)</span>. The interactive features enabled by <strong>ggvis</strong> are similar to those available in <strong>shiny</strong>. For example the <code>input_slider()</code> function in <strong>ggvis</strong> creates an interactive slider equivalent to the functionality of <strong>shiny</strong>’s <code>sliderInput()</code>. Both software tools need to be connected to a R session in order for the interactive plots to be active. When applying interactive data visualisation for exploration and early stages of analysis, this is particularly useful because it allows the statistical analysis in R to respond directly to interactive inputs via visuals <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-ggvis">2017</a><a href="#ref-ggvis">b</a>)</span>. However for the purpose of presentation, interactive graphics created using <strong>ggvis</strong> or <strong>shiny</strong> would need to be hosted on a server in order to have access to an active R session. In contrast, interactive <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>crosstalk</strong> visuals are easy to share as a standalone HTML <span class="citation">(Seivert <a href="#ref-plotly">2017</a>)</span>. In comparison to <strong>shiny</strong>, more aspects of <strong>ggvis</strong> are still underdevelopment and hence there may be significant changes to its current interfaces <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-ggvis">2017</a><a href="#ref-ggvis">b</a>)</span>. Furthermore, <strong>shiny</strong> has the extra advantage of being compatible with a range of other software, such as <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>crosstalk</strong>, whilst providing similar interactive functionality as <strong>ggvis</strong>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> The focal set of software tools</h2>
<p>For teaching interactive data visualisation the set of focal tools <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> were identified and selected using the criterion ease of application, development progress and coverage of interactive techniques.</p>
<div id="coverage-of-interactive-techniques" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Coverage of interactive techniques</h3>
<p>The interactive techniques discussed in Section <a href="#techniques">2</a> are not intended to be exhaustive, but they provide a powerful toolbox for applying interactive data visualisation <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The tables below summarise how well the set of interactive software tools, <strong>shiny</strong>, <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>crosstalk</strong>, implement the interactive techniques discussed.</p>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:techniques">3.1</a> examines the coverage of each package as a standalone software. For example, unless <strong>crosstalk</strong> is combined with <strong>shiny</strong> it does not have access to an active R session. Although this feature is not an interactive technique, it has been included in Table <a href="#tab:techniques">3.1</a> since having access to statistical software enables a two-way workflow between data analysis and plot interaction <span class="citation">(Wickham et al. <a href="#ref-pipe">2009</a>)</span>. As previously discussed, this enables the implementation of techniques like subset selection for analysis, but affects the ease of sharing interactive visualisations.</p>
<p>Linked brushing is summarised separately in Table <a href="#tab:brushing">3.2</a> since there is a variety of ways to define linking rules. Furthermore the implementation of linked brushing generally requires the packages to be combined. Brushing lines was not observed in any examples and appears to be currently not possible using the tools examined. In addition to the interactive software specified, dynamic tours would also require the use of the <strong>tourr</strong> package.</p>

<p>The <strong>plotly</strong> package provides a starting point that enables the application of a variety of interactive techniques. The default settings for a <strong>plotly</strong> object allow for tooltip identification, scaling and filtering via the legend (where applicable). Interactive plots can be created by either converting static <strong>ggplot2</strong> plots to <strong>plotly</strong> objects, or directly using the <code>plot_ly</code> function. The <strong>plotly</strong> syntax is conveniently similar to <strong>ggplot2</strong>. Although <strong>ggplot2</strong> provides a more extensive system of graphics, creating interactive visualisations with the <code>plot_ly</code> function uses the <strong>plotly.js</strong> library more directly <span class="citation">(Sievert <a href="#ref-plotlyBook">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Combining <strong>plotly</strong> with <strong>crosstalk</strong> introduces the key interactive technique of brushing to link multiple plots. Linked brushing can also be achieved by using <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> together, but the <code>SharedData</code> environment of the <strong>crosstalk</strong> package allows default one-to-one linked brushing between any plots sharing the same environment. Hence little additional code is required to implement basic linked brushing when using <strong>crosstalk</strong>. In contrast, using <strong>shiny</strong> involves writing code to ‘manually’ subset the selected data using the reactive output from the plot interaction. This enables categorical brushing, as demonstrated in Figure <a href="#fig:catbrush">2.3</a>. A similar approach can be applied to achieve brushing on aggregated data using <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>, but more code and effort would be required as the complexity of area plots increase.</p>
<p>The <strong>crosstalk</strong> package takes advantage of the variety of web-based graphics that are available by providing interactivity between HTML widgets. Hence it is intended to be used with other software, like <strong>plotly</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>. However the <strong>crosstalk</strong> package is not appropriate for use with large datasets and currently supports only the interactive techniques of linked brushing and filtering views <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-crosstalk">2017</a><a href="#ref-crosstalk">a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the set of software tools, the <strong>shiny</strong> package provides a connection to R when the interactive data visualisation requires it. However enabling analysis that responds to interactivity comes at a cost. Compared to the other two packages, more code and effort is generally required to set up the three-component structure behind <strong>shiny</strong> apps. Consequently the learning curve is also greater, but <strong>shiny</strong> is well supported with online tutorials and exemplars <span class="citation">(RStudio <a href="#ref-shiny">2017</a><a href="#ref-shiny">c</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> The role of interactive visualisation in data analysis</h1>
<p>This section examines the use of interactive visualisation techniques in exploratory data analysis on the performance of New Zealand schools in the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) in 2016. The role of interactive techniques in enhancing analysis will be highlighted and demonstrated through worked examples using <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong>.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Key findings with regards to the use of interactive techniques in data analysis will be noted explicitly as they are demonstrated using the NCEA dataset.
</p>
</div>
<div id="the-ncea-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The NCEA dataset</h2>
<p>Data on the achievement rates of schools across the four NCEA qualification levels, Level One, Two, Three (L1, L2, L3) and University Entrance (UE), were obtained from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) website.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Students need to demonstrate sufficient mastery of standards at each respective NCEA level in order to be awarded the qualification. The UE qualification differs from L3, in that the standards achieved need to be from university endorsed Level Three subjects and specific requirements for literacy and numeracy must be met.</p>
<p>Information on the school decile, region and a small cohort warning, were also provided in the data. The decile rating is a measure of the general income level of the families of students attending the school. The decile rating ranges from one to ten, with ten representing the highest socio-economic level. A handful of schools have a decile rating of zero, due to unique circumstances that make them exempt from the measure. The achievement rate of a school for each qualification level was quantified in a few ways. The achievement indicator chosen for this analysis was the proportion of students at the school who were successful in obtaining the qualification level, given that they were entered in enough standards to have the opportunity to earn the qualification in the 2016 school year. This is referred to as the “Current Year Achievement Rate” for the “Participating Cohort” by the NZQA.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After tidying the data retrieved from the NZQA website, the <strong>NCEA</strong> dataset consists of four real-valued variables, the achievement rates for L1, L2, L3, UE, and one categorical variable for the decile rating of the school. Only schools with achievement indicators across all four qualification levels were retained, thus reducing the dataset to 408 schools from around New Zealand. The focus of analysis will be on its subset of 91 Auckland schools, but the <strong>NCEA</strong> dataset of 408 New Zealand schools will be used to demonstrate how interactive techniques can aid graphical analysis when observations increase. The sensitivity of analysis to samples size for the <strong>NCEA</strong> dataset will also be explored interactively.</p>
<p>Analysis of data for the Auckland subset will be the focus because it is less affected by the unreliability of small sample sizes. Auckland has many of the larger schools since it is the most populated city in New Zealand. The first few observations from the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset of 91 schools are shown in Table <a href="#tab:akl">4.1</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Static visual analysis</h2>
<p>A question that naturally arises from the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset is whether a school’s performance is related to its decile rating. Multiple views of the data will be used to explore this question, starting with simple low dimensional representations before examining complex multivariate structures <span class="citation">(Unwin <a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The pairs plot in Figure <a href="#fig:pairs">4.1</a> shows an increasing lower bound for achievement rates at L1, L2 and L3, as decile increases, but there is a lot of scatter above this boundary. We can also see the spread of achievement rates varying across decile groups. The variation in achievement rates decreases as the decile increases (from one), across the L1, L2 and L3 qualification levels. In the bivariate scatterplots there are many schools approaching the maximum 100% achievement rate, for L1, L2 and L3, hence it is not surprising to see their univariate distributions are skewed to the left in Figure <a href="#fig:hists">4.2</a>. The distribution of achievement rates for UE is less skewed and hints at two possible groupings. Furthermore achievement rates in the qualification levels appear to be positively correlated, especially between L1 and L2. Hence the low-dimensional plots indicate non-normality, unequal spread between groups and multicollinearity.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Multivariate visual representations</h2>
<p>The pairs plot in Figure <a href="#fig:pairs">4.1</a> provided a glimpse into the multivariate distribution of achievement rates across the four qualification levels. The parallel coordinates plot in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpAkl">4.3</a> allows us to further compare the multivariate distributions of achievement rates for different decile groups, as well as identify high dimensional clusters and outliers, if they exist.</p>
<p>The ordering of axes in a parallel coordinates plots (PCP) greatly affects the quality of the graphical analysis, hence interactivity that enables reordering of axes is recommended <span class="citation">Unwin (<a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span>. In the case of the NCEA data, the natural ordering of the four qualification levels by difficulty, coincides with the recommendation from <span class="citation">Cook and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span> to order the axes based on correlation. In addition, <span class="citation">Unwin (<a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span> highlights the layering of colours also needs to be considered carefully, since the last group assigned a colour will dominate the other lines.</p>
<p>The higher decile schools in Auckland appear to dominate the high achievement rates across all qualification levels, while lower decile schools are less consistent in terms of their performance across the levels. Although there are only 91 observations (lines), it is quite difficult to identify even ‘ball park boundaries’, on the 10-point decile scale, to distinguish between ‘higher’ and ‘lower’ decile schools when describing possible patterns.</p>

<p>The following two plots demonstrate how alpha blending can help minimise the effects of overplotting as the number of observations increase. It is easier to check whether the patterns identified in Auckland schools extend to the 408 New Zealand schools in the <strong>NCEA</strong> dataset, using Figure <a href="#fig:pcpAlpha">4.5</a> where alpha blending is applied, rather than Figure <a href="#fig:pcpNZ">4.4</a>. The performance of high achieving lower decile schools is less ‘drowned out’ by the dominance of their higher decile counterparts, when alpha blending is used. Figure <a href="#fig:pcpAlpha">4.5</a> reveals a group of schools converging at 100% achievement for L3, but with varying levels of success at L2 and UE. It would be of interest to compare the achievement rates of these schools across the qualification levels. Similarly, we would be interested in tracking the performance of the school with the lowest achievement rate at L1. The school appears to make a convincing recovery in performance at L2, but it is impossible to follow its progress further in a static PCP, due to overplotting. Interactive techniques will be applied to explore these points of interest.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Leveraging static plots with interactivity</h2>
<p>Although one of the strengths of a PCP is in identifying multivariate features, such as outliers <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>, the static plots in Figures <a href="#fig:pcpNZ">4.4</a> and <a href="#fig:pcpAlpha">4.5</a> do not allow these features to be explored, due to overplotting. The use of colour and interactive techniques are recommended for maximising the effectiveness of a PCP. <span class="citation">Venables and Ripley (<a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span> argue parallel coordinate plots are “often too ‘busy’ without means of interaction” (p. 315). The interactive filtering feature in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpInt">4.6</a> addresses the problem of overplotting by allowing the user to isolate the distribution of each decile group (via a double-click on the legend). Furthermore, using the mouse to drag-and-select nodes on the parallel axes, brushes and links the achievement rates of individual schools across all qualification levels. Lastly the hovering tooltip enables instant identification of individual schools by name.</p>

Figure <a href="#fig:pcpL3">4.8</a> illustrates how brushing the point where L3=100% on the interactive PCP, highlights the extent of the variability in performance at the other qualification levels. Surprisingly, the distribution of UE achievement rates for schools with 100% achievement at L3, is just as spread out as the overall performance of New Zealand schools in the dataset. Many of these schools also obtained 100% achievement rates at L2, but again there is surprisingly variable success at L1.</p>

<p>The query made via linked brushing in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpL3">4.8</a> is similar to subsetting the data using the code shown below. A summary could be used to examine the performance of the subset of 42 schools across the other qualifications, but making sense of this summary would required comparison with statistics for the whole dataset. Furthermore the summary hides the unusual performance of individual schools at certain qualification levels. The interactive techniques allowed us to gain insights about the NCEA data, that would have been difficult to ascertain from static plots or numeric summaries alone.</p>

Linked brushing and tooltip identification, allow fast querying of unusual patterns, groups and/or individuals. The instant visual feedback is especially useful for exploratory analysis.
</p>
</div>
<p>However the ease and effectiveness of linked brushing can also be affected by overplotting. Figure <a href="#fig:pcpBusy">4.9</a> demonstrates how an attempt to use persistent brushing to identify the UE success rate of the school with 100% achievement at L3, but unusually low performance at L2, resulted in accidentally brushing an observation with a similar L2 achievement rate. The <strong>plotly</strong> R package used in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpInt">4.6</a> allows only the nodes of the PCP to be brushed. The <strong>ggobi</strong> GUI applies the same drag-and-select motion to brush both points and lines on a PCP <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. This greater flexibility would have avoided the issues caused by overplotting in this case, but some of the challenges of large datasets for static graphical displays will persist, even with interactive techniques. In particular, <span class="citation">Unwin (<a href="#ref-GDA">2015</a>)</span> highlights the speed of rendering plots for large datasets, or lack thereof, can limit whether the techniques can be applied “fast enough to be considered interactive” (p. 20).</p>

The effectiveness of interactive techniques for large datasets will be affected by rendering delays and limitations imposed by plot size and resolution.

<p>The positive relationships previously identified in the pairs plot, should translate to approximately horizontal lines between the parallel axes in the PCP, as opposed to sloped or ‘criss-crossed’ lines for negative correlation. By changing the scale of the PCP to an univariate scale, such as the standardised scale shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpscale">4.10</a>, we can verify the correlation between successive achievement rates, by taking into consideration the increasing difficulty of the qualification levels as well. The parallel coordinate plots in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpscale">4.10</a> question whether the positive relationships hold true for Auckland schools with low achievement rates and in some decile groups.</p>

<p>Changes in the scaling of the axes offer different views of the structures. Using univariate scaling, either standardising or using the minimum and maximum of individual variables for each scale, encourages comparisons between observations to be made. Meanwhile a global scale, such as the applying the overall range to all scales, encourages comparisons across the variables. Hence the first two scaling choices in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpscale">4.10</a> focuses on ranking schools in the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset and comparing achievement rates within qualification levels. Being able to compare the effects of scaling quickly and dynamically, highlights the common patterns that can be identified. In particular, the dominance of the higher decile schools and the inconsistent performance across qualification levels for some deciles.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Interactivity allows different scales to be examined quickly and dynamically. Hence the effect of important plot design decisions, such as scaling, can be considered thoroughly and different views of the data explored.
</p>
</div>
<p>The parallel coordinate plots suggest that patterns of performance across decile groups, if they exist, are difficult to distinguish at the multivariate level for Auckland schools. Hence principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to further examine the underlying multivariate structures. A plot of the first two principal components of the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaAkl">4.11</a>. Line segments with labels of the original variable names are used to represent the loadings of the principal components. The loadings are the contributions of each variable to the linear combinations that define the principal components <span class="citation">(Venables and Ripley <a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span>. Since all four variable axes are orientated horizontally in the same direction, the first principal component reflects the schools’ general performance across all four qualification levels. The vertical separation between the UE axis and the remaining axes, indicates that the second principal component contrasts performance in UE against the other qualifications. Not surprisingly the plot shows more spread across the first principal component since it explains a much greater proportion of the variation in the data. The first principal component reveals a division between the majority of schools and a smaller group, that is positioned away from the variable axes shown. The decile of the schools is represented by the colour and plotting symbol. The smaller group of schools appear to be decile five and below, except for one decile nine school. There is also a decile ten school that appears to be unusual when examining both principal components. The use of colour highlights the remaining decile nine and ten schools as similar in performance, as weighted by the principal components. On the other hand, schools from the other deciles seem to be more spread out from each other in the PCA plot.</p>

Figure 4.11: First two principal components for Auckland schools
</p>
</div>
<p>The principal components plot in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaAkl">4.11</a> provided a view of the multivariate distribution of the Auckland schools dataset that was less easily affected by overplotting than a static PCP. Hence refinements on observations were possible. From the parallel coordinate plots we observed that higher decile schools performed more consistently with each other and dominated across the four qualification levels, but it was difficult to quantify the decile ‘cut off’ for such schools. The PCA suggests these schools are the decile nine and ten Auckland schools, with the exception of two schools. Again interactive tooltips enable instant identification of these two unusual observations, in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaInt">4.12</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore the two plots in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaInt">4.12</a> are interactively linked by brushing. Individual or groups of points in the PCA plot can be brushed via a drag-and-select motion using the mouse. The ‘Lasso Select’ option can be activated from the hovering menu on the top right hand corner, if the region of points to be selected is irregular rather than rectangular. The original achievement rates of the selected schools will be highlighted in the PCP, while the lines for the unselected schools will be dimmed. Similarly brushing on the nodes of the PCP highlights the observations on the PCA plot.</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:brushGroup">4.13</a> demonstrates the use of the lasso brush to highlight the original variable values of the central group of points in the PCA plot. The linked brushing and tooltip identification reveals that these Auckland schools have at least 80% achievement rates at all four qualification levels, except for UE. We are also able to identify the only decile one school in this group.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>In a similar manner to Figure <a href="#fig:pcpBusy">4.9</a>, persistent brushing can be applied with different colours to further explore the multivariate features revealed by the PCA. The three outliers brushed in the PCA plot are at two extremes. Comparing their achievement rates on the PCP helps to explain why they are unusual in different ways. Two of the outliers had consistently high performance at the first three qualification levels, but there was a drastic drop in the UE achievement rate. Although, as previously observed, lower performance at UE was shared by the Auckland schools in general, the large differences between the two schools’ achievement rates for UE and the remaining qualification levels are still unexpected. The single outlier at the other extreme of the PCA plot, defies the general trend. Its L1 achievement rate was inconsistently lower than the other qualification levels, rather its UE rate. Although all three schools had unusual performance compared to Auckland schools in general, the inconsistencies in their performance differed. The linked brushing enabled us to further investigate the differences in ‘unusualness’ and it also highlights how the multivariate outliers identified in the PCA are hidden in the PCP.</p>

The insights into multidimensional data structures gained from individual static plots were extended when linked brushing was applied.

<p>Initiating the linked brushing from the PCP is also useful. Figure <a href="#fig:brushOutPCP">4.15</a> confirms the outliers visible in the PCP are also identified as outliers in the PCA.

<p>The NZQA indicator of a small cohort was at a very low threshold of fewer than five candidates at any qualification level.

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:pcaSize">4.16</a> explores the effect of sample size on the principal component analysis of the <strong>NCEA</strong> dataset. The interactive slider subsets the schools according to their minimum cohort size before PCA is performed. The effect of varying the sample size can be dynamically viewed by selecting the ‘play’ icon on the slider of the <strong>shiny</strong> app in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaSize">4.16</a>. In order to explore multiple sample sizes there needs to be flexibility in subseting the dataset and then performing PCA. A new range of sample sizes can be explored quickly by modifying the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> arguments of the following line of code from the <strong>shiny</strong> app:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sliderInput(&quot;cohort2&quot;, label=&quot;Minimum size of Year 11, 12, 13 cohorts&quot;, min=0, max=100, 
            step=10, value=0, animate=T)</code></pre>
<p>If <strong>crosstalk</strong> had been used to provide the animation in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaSize">4.16</a> instead of <strong>shiny</strong>, all data for the PCA and plotting would need to be pregenerated. This would require more memory usage and additional code to organise the volume of data. Hence making <strong>shiny</strong> a more efficient software choice in this situation.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of different software allows for efficient application of interactive techniques.

<p>The pattern previously noted for Auckland schools, where decile nine and ten schools were more consistent with each other in performance than the other deciles, appears to hold for New Zealand schools in general. Not surprisingly, as the minimum cohort size increases, the spread in the PCA plot decreases and the first principal component is able to explain more of the variation in the data. The axes for the original variables, reflecting the loadings of the principal components, remain reasonably consistent. The first principal component generally measures overall performance across the four qualification levels, while the second component contrasts L1 and L2 performance against L3 and UE.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Dynamic visualisation allows multiple analyses to be computed and compared quickly. The flexibility of being able to pause animations allows closer examination of details, as the need arises.
</p>
</div>
<p>The interactive drop-down menu also allows us to quickly verify whether there are any underlying relationships between achievement rates and demographics other than decile, that are worth further investigation. Although the other demographic variables did not reveal any further insight, the ease with which these additional variables could be interactively linked to the PCA plot, justified their inclusion in the exploratory data analysis. Enabling the interactive drop-down menu in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaSize">4.16</a> involved adding the following single command to the code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>selectInput(&quot;group&quot;, &quot;Select variable&quot;, choices=as.list(colnames(nzqa.sch)[6:15]), selected=&quot;Decile&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
When interactive techniques can be applied with ease, the trade-off between the effort required to implement the techniques and the level of insight gained, is generally favourable.
</p>
</div>
<p>The ease with which the other demographic variables could be investigated in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaSize">4.16</a> also emphasises the value of applying interactive techniques in exploratory data analysis. <span class="citation">Cook and Swayne (<a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span> highlights how interactive data visualisation supports “slipping out of dead-ends and chasing down new leads” (p. 11).</p>

Applying interactive data visualisation encourages further exploration of the data. Questions are addressed quickly and more questions arise from probing the data with interactive techniques.

<div id="displaying-models-in-data-space" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Displaying models in data space</h2>
<p>The plot of the first two principal components of the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaAkl">4.11</a> suggests that there is a group of schools with similar achievement patterns. Projections of the first few principal components will often reveal any underlying structure in the data <span class="citation">(Venables and Ripley <a href="#ref-Mass">2002</a>)</span>. However, instead of simplifying data to display it in the model space, as is the case in Figure <a href="#fig:pcaAkl">4.11</a>, <span class="citation">Wickham, Cook, and Hofmann (<a href="#ref-blindfold">2015</a>)</span> encourage visualisations of models in data space. They demonstrate how linked brushing between visual representations of summary statistics and tours displaying models allow subsets of models to be compared.</p>
<p>To further explore the four-dimensional space spanned by the achievement rate variables in the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset, a guided tour using the holes index was applied to enable further investigation into how schools differ in their performance. This projection pursuit index seeks out projections with few points at the centre <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>. Pairwise combinations of the first four principal components will provide the initial 2D projections for each tour, hence six guided tours will be launched from different starting points in the four-dimensional data space.</p>
<p>In Figure <a href="#fig:nceaTour">4.17</a> the ‘Pursuit index’ plot is linked to each tour animation via a mouse click on its pursuit index trace. The matrix of final tour projections and axes positions, on the far right, is a static plot that also allows for quick comparisons between the different tours. Viewing the plots together highlights that tours finishing at similar index values appear to have final projections that are rotations of the same view. This suggests that the tour paths were gravitating towards the same region of the four-dimensional space. However no two tours will contain exactly the same projections <span class="citation">(Cook and Swayne <a href="#ref-Cook">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The projection captured in Figure <a href="#fig:nceaTour">4.17</a> is from the tour that uses the third and fourth principal components as a starting basis. It makes sense that this tour began with the lowest holes index, since the first two principal components are projections of maximal variance. Consequently this provided the longest tour, with more views of the data space. The interactive sliders allow projections to be reviewed in more detail. Once an interesting view is found, linked brushing can be applied to relate the projections back to the original variables.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The tour plot in Figure <a href="#fig:nceaTour">4.17</a> shows a projection with a hole separating the data. Brushing the group of points below the hole, links with a second row of plots, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:nceaTourUE">4.18</a>. This group of schools generally have above average achievement rates across all four qualification levels, with the exception of one school. The inclusion of this school suggests that one of the features that relates these schools together is their relatively high achievement rates in UE, compared to other schools. Apart from two schools all of these schools are from decile seven and above. All decile ten schools are included in this group.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
Interactive techniques like linked brushing and tours, allow multiple views of the data to be examined at the same time. Consequently leading to a more thorough exploration of data structures.

<p>The PCP in Figure <a href="#fig:nceaTourUE">4.18</a> reuses the code from Figure <a href="#fig:pcpscale">4.10</a>. Similarly, the tour plot builds on the work and effort spent creating Figure <a href="#fig:crabstour">2.6</a>. For complex interactive techniques like tours, it is particularly important to be able to reuse the code, otherwise it becomes too costly, in terms of time and effort, to apply such techniques in exploratory data analysis.</p>
<div class="boxed">
<p>
A code-based approach allows interactive visualisations to be reused and easily extended for new explorations. This makes the learning curve and initial investment in time and effort more worthwhile.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Findings for the Auckland dataset</h2>
<p>The exploratory data analysis on the <strong>Auckland</strong> dataset highlighted that there is no general relationship between the decile rating of a school and its 2016 NCEA achievement rates. Other than decile nine and ten schools, patterns of achievement for the remaining decile levels are inconclusive. Decile nine and ten schools perform consistently at a high level across the four qualifications and they form part of a small group of schools from predominantly decile five and above who have similar achievement rates to each other.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This paper examined how interactive techniques have been applied in data analysis and demonstrated the practicalities and value of using current open-source, code-based software to implement interactive data visualisation. A survey of the interactive techniques and open-source software currently available was reviewed and the software tools were then evaluated against these techniques. The focal set of software tools <strong>plotly</strong>, <strong>crosstalk</strong> and <strong>shiny</strong> were established and used to explore the role of interactive data visualisation in the data analysis cycle.</p>
<p>The interactive techniques were then applied in exploratory data analysis of results from the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). The insights gained by applying interactive data visualisation, compared to what was possible by using static visuals alone, demonstrated that it would be worthwhile for graduate statisticians to be familiar with the set of interactive techniques and software identified.</p>
<p>In light of Tukey’s comments in the opening, this paper has demonstrated how statisticians can access a powerful toolbox of interactive techniques to enrich their data analysis and shows that interactive data visualisations is worth teaching.</p>
